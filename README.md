# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Project

## Objectives :-

I will explore the data and try to answer some questions like:

  * What's the % of Churn Customers and customers that keep in with the active services?
  * Is there any patterns in Churn Customers based on the gender?
  * Is there any patterns/preference in Churn Customers based on the type of service provided?
  * What's the most profitable service types?
  * Which features and services are most profitable?
  * Many more questions that will arise during the analysis

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/gmrsingha/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Project/blob/main/Dataset.xls">Customer Churn Dataset</a>

## Technology Used:
- Python,jupyter notebook

## Process

- Analyzed 7,043 customer records from a telecom dataset to identify churn patterns using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn).
- Engineered features and trained models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) achieving 80% accuracy in predicting customer churn.
- Visualized key churn drivers using Python (Seaborn & Matplotlib), highlighting impactful features like contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.
- Demonstrated end-to-end data analysis skills, from cleaning and exploration to modeling and insight communicationâ€”reinforcing real-world problem-solving ability.

## Project Insights

- The model effectively predicts customer churn, with strong performance in identifying non-churn customers and notable accuracy in churn detection.
- Customer attrition poses a direct threat to revenue and long-term profitability.
- Key drivers of churn can be addressed through improved customer service and proactive engagement.
- Personalized experiences and loyalty programs help foster stronger customer relationships and reduce churn risk.
- Gathering feedback from former customers provides actionable insights to refine retention strategies.

## Final Conclusion:

According to the confusion matrix, the algorithm predicts 1400 of the actual non-churn values to be non-churn and 149 to be churn, for a total of 1400+149=1549. 
In contrast, the system predicts 324 churn values and 237 non-churn values out of the 237+324=561 actual churn values.

Customer attrition is undoubtedly detrimental to a company's bottom line.There are several tactics that can be used to stop client attrition. Knowing its clients well is the best approach for a business to prevent customer attrition. 
This entails determining which clients are most likely to leave and making efforts to increase their level of satisfaction.Naturally,the first step in addressing this issue is to improve customer service.
Another tactic to lower client churn is to foster customer loyalty with pertinent experiences and tailored service.
In order to take a proactive stance against future customer attrition, several businesses survey their ex-customers to learn why they left.
